# Survival-Game
This is a survival game in development, the main idea is to develop basic features that other survival games have. I am using
 the godot engine. I had previously tried to make a survival game, but due to lack of time i had to give up. You can follow the previous try [here](https://github.com/Bufige/Survival-Game)

# What is currently done or what will be done:
You can follow the progress of the game [here](https://www.notion.so/Survival-Game-using-godot-ac1b11ab7b5d466ab53b6d844f0274bd). There contains more info about the project, there are links that you can watch me code or follow the ideas of what is to be implemented. I try to livestream them.

# Why the art of the game is so poor? 
I have no skills to develop the game art, so those assets that i use are free and available in the internet. In case you want to help me with the art, try to contact me.

# How to run this thing?

Just clone this project or download and open it with the godot engine. Currently using godot 3.2.
